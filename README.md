## Extension Section

### üåê **CryptVault Extension Overview**
<img src="cryptimages/c3.jpeg" alt="Home Page" width="600"/>
- The **CryptVault Extension** is a browser add-on designed to enhance security and convenience by auto-filling saved credentials on login pages. It communicates exclusively with the local CryptVault application via localhost (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8000`), ensuring no data is transmitted over the internet. This offline-first approach minimizes exposure to external threats, making it a robust solution for privacy-conscious users.

### üîë **Extension Login Page**

- Upon installation, the extension prompts users to log in with their master password to authenticate with the local CryptVault app.


- **Details**: This page ensures secure initialization by validating the master password against the locally stored encrypted database. Only after successful authentication can the extension access and manage credentials.

### üìã **Fetching Page**
- When a user visits a login page (e.g., a website), the extension detects the URL and offers to auto-fill the username and password fields with saved credentials.

- **Details**: The auto-fill feature leverages the Chrome Extension API to match the current webpage URL with stored entries. It fetches encrypted data from the local server, decrypts it in real-time using the master password, and populates the fields securely. Users can select from multiple saved credentials if available for the site.

### ‚öôÔ∏è  **Autofill Page **
- The Autofill page allows users to view fetched credentials and automatically fill login forms with a single click. It displays stored usernames and passwords (fetched securely from the local CryptVault app) for the active website, offering a seamless and secure login experience.
- **Details**:This panel shows matching credentials based on the currently open site, along with a ‚ÄúShow‚Äù button to reveal the password (after user authentication if needed) and an ‚ÄúAutofill‚Äù button to insert credentials directly into the form. Communication is handled locally over localhost, ensuring no sensitive data is exposed to the internet. This feature combines convenience with full user control, reinforcing privacy without compromising usability.
