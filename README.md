Extension Section
üåê CryptVault Extension Overview

The CryptVault Extension is a browser add-on designed to enhance security and convenience by auto-filling saved credentials on login pages. It communicates exclusively with the local CryptVault application via localhost (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:8000), ensuring no data is transmitted over the internet. This offline-first approach minimizes exposure to external threats, making it a robust solution for privacy-conscious users.

üîë Extension Login Page

Upon installation, the extension prompts users to log in with their master password to authenticate with the local CryptVault app.
Details: This page ensures secure initialization by validating the master password against the locally stored encrypted database. Only after successful authentication can the extension access and manage credentials.

üìã Credential Auto-Fill Page

When a user visits a login page (e.g., a website), the extension detects the URL and offers to auto-fill the username and password fields with saved credentials.
Details: The auto-fill feature leverages the Chrome Extension API to match the current webpage URL with stored entries. It fetches encrypted data from the local server, decrypts it in real-time using the master password, and populates the fields securely. Users can select from multiple saved credentials if available for the site.

‚öôÔ∏è Extension Settings Page

The settings page allows users to configure auto-fill preferences, manage connected sites, and update the extension‚Äôs sync with the CryptVault app.
Details: This page provides options to enable/disable auto-fill, clear cached data, or re-authenticate with the local app. It ensures users retain control over how and when credentials are accessed, enhancing usability and security.
