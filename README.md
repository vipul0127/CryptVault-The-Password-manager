## Extension Section

### üåê **CryptVault Extension Overview**
- The **CryptVault Extension** is a browser add-on designed to enhance security and convenience by auto-filling saved credentials on login pages. It communicates exclusively with the local CryptVault application via localhost (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8000`), ensuring no data is transmitted over the internet. This offline-first approach minimizes exposure to external threats, making it a robust solution for privacy-conscious users.

### üîë **Extension Login Page**
- Upon installation, the extension prompts users to log in with their master password to authenticate with the local CryptVault app.

- **Details**: This page ensures secure initialization by validating the master password against the locally stored encrypted database. Only after successful authentication can the extension access and manage credentials.

### üìã **Credential Auto-Fill Page**
- When a user visits a login page (e.g., a website), the extension detects the URL and offers to auto-fill the username and password fields with saved credentials.

- **Details**: The auto-fill feature leverages the Chrome Extension API to match the current webpage URL with stored entries. It fetches encrypted data from the local server, decrypts it in real-time using the master password, and populates the fields securely. Users can select from multiple saved credentials if available for the site.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Extension Settings Page**
- The settings page allows users to configure auto-fill preferences, manage connected sites, and update the extension‚Äôs sync with the CryptVault app.

- **Details**: This page provides options to enable/disable auto-fill, clear cached data, or re-authenticate with the local app. It ensures users retain control over how and when credentials are accessed, enhancing usability and security.

## Installation and Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vipul0127/CryptVault.git
cd CryptVault

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Create a virtual environment and install required packages:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Details:** This step sets up an isolated Python environment to avoid conflicts and installs all necessary libraries listed in `requirements.txt`, such as Django, PyQt5, and PyInstaller.

### Step 3: Build the Executable

**Details:** Open your browser (e.g., Chrome), go to `chrome://extensions/`, enable "Developer mode," and select the extension folder to load. This integrates the extension with the local CryptVault app.

### Step 5: Run the Application
Launch the generated `.exe` file to start CryptVault.

**Details:** Double-click the `.exe` file in the `dist` folder to initiate the application, prompting the user to log in with their master password.

## Usage
